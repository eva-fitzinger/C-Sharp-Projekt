With a new virus scanner it is now possible to see how many people in your immediate vicinity are infected. Sadly, everyone just knows the number of infected people around them, but not who the infected people are. Your goal is to identify all infected people without touching them. If you identified an infected person, please put a mask on them, so we can all stay safe. Sadly, the number of masks is limited, so only people who are infected should wear a mask.
Try your best! The future of humanity depends on you!
